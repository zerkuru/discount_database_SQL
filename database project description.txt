 discount_system database description 

1. The database discount_system is used for:
   - storing information on clients, sales, products, storges (shops),
     increasing and reducing of bonus points for the participants of bonus program, discounts, discount campaignes, 
   - calculation of current bonus point balance
   - discount calculation of permanent and temporary discount programs
   - current sales history of the client
   - bonus points history of the client
   - sales analysis 

   The current base is not a storage or accounting system, cannot be used for accurate accounting balance or storage balance information, might be used as a data storage of discount programs for separate storages and applications (mobile shop application) 
   Autonomous database for discount and sales information allows to complete discount calculation independently from different accounting, sales or storage systems through the chain, including foreing systems and consolidate client information and sales information from the systems.

- outcoming data always includes external_id for clients, products, sales, etc.
